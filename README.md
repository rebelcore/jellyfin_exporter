Prometheus exporter for Jellyfin Media System metrics exposed
in Go with pluggable metric collectors.

## Installation and Usage

If you are new to Prometheus and `jellyfin_exporter` there is
a [simple step-by-step guide](https://docs.rebelcore.org/guides/jellyfin/exporter).

The `jellyfin_exporter` listens on HTTP port 9594 by default.
See the `--help` output for more options.

The flag `--jellyfin.token` is required. You can generate an API
Key in the Jellyfin admin dashboard.

### Ansible

Coming Soon!

### Docker

The `jellyfin_exporter` is designed to monitor your Jellyfin Media System.

For situations where containerized deployment is needed, you will
need to set the Jellyfin URL flag to use the docker container hostname.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 9594:9594 \
  rebelcore/jellyfin-exporter:latest \
  --jellyfin.address=http://jellyfin:8096 \
  --jellyfin.token=TOKEN
```

For Docker compose, similar flag changes are needed.

```yaml
---
services:
  jellyfin_exporter:
    image: rebelcore/jellyfin-exporter:latest
    container_name: jellyfin_exporter
    command:
      - '--jellyfin.address=http://jellyfin:8096'
      - '--jellyfin.token=TOKEN'
    ports:
      - 9594:9594
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Grafana Dashboard
Refer to [this repository](https://github.com/rebelcore/jellyfin_grafana) to check out the official dashboard for the exporter.

## Collectors

There is varying support for collectors.
The tables below list all existing collectors.

Collectors are enabled by providing a `--collector.<name>` flag.
Collectors that are enabled by default can be disabled
by providing a `--no-collector.<name>` flag.
To enable only some specific collector(s),
use `--collector.disable-defaults --collector.<name> ...`.

### Enabled by default

| Name    | Description                                        |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| media   | Exposes media totals in the system by type.        |
| playing | Exposes media that users are now playing.          |
| system  | Exposes if the Jellyfin server is online or not.   |
| users   | Exposes users and if they are currently connected. |

### Disabled by default

`jellyfin_exporter` also implements a number of collectors that
are disabled by default. Reasons for this vary by collector,
and may include:

* Plugin Required

You can enable additional collectors as desired by adding them
to your init system's or service supervisor's startup configuration
for `jellyfin_exporter` but caution is advised. Enable at most one
at a time, testing first on a non-production system, then by hand
on a single production node. When enabling additional collectors,
you should carefully monitor the change by observing the
`scrape_duration_seconds` metric to ensure that collection completes
and does not time out. In addition, monitor the
`scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling` metric to see the changes
in cardinality.

| Name     | Description                                             |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| activity | Exposes information from the Playback Reporting plugin. |

### Activity Collector

The `activity` collector can be enabled with `--collector.activity`.
It supports exposing metrics from the Playback Reporting plugin.
To use this collector you will need to enable the plugin first and
edit the setting `Keep data for` and set it to `Forever`. The option
`collector.activity.days` is set to 100 years in days by default to
show the max amount of data. You can modify the amount of days to pull
from, but it's recommended to leave it at its default for best data reporting.

### Filtering enabled collectors

The `jellyfin_exporter` will expose all metrics from enabled collectors
by default. This is the recommended way to collect metrics to avoid errors.

For advanced use the `jellyfin_exporter` can be passed an optional list
of collectors to filter metrics. The `collect[]` parameter may be used
multiple times. In Prometheus configuration you can use this syntax under
the [scrape config](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#<scrape_config>).

```
  params:
    collect[]:
      - foo
      - bar
```

This can be useful for having different Prometheus servers collect
specific metrics from nodes.

## Development building and running

Prerequisites:

* [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/)
* RHEL/CentOS: `glibc-static` package.

Building:

    git clone https://github.com/rebelcore/jellyfin_exporter.git
    cd jellyfin_exporter
    make build
    ./jellyfin_exporter <flags>

To see all available configuration flags:

    ./jellyfin_exporter --help

## Running tests

    make test

## TLS endpoint

**EXPERIMENTAL**

The exporter supports TLS via a new web configuration file.

```console
./jellyfin_exporter --web.config.file=web-config.yml
```

See
the [exporter-toolkit web-configuration](https://github.com/prometheus/exporter-toolkit/blob/master/docs/web-configuration.md)
for more details.
